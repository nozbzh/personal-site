    | ,&nbsp;a developer bootcamp in Paris. This 9-week intensive program is where I learned Ruby on Rails through hands-on exercises and pair-programming. The course culminated in a capstone project where I was part of a team of 3 who built a marketplace prototype for high-end furniture,&nbsp;

        | Prior to being a web developer, I was a scuba diving instructor and I spent several years in South East Asia, where I taught myself Indonesian and Malay. I learned how to take apart regulators. A regulator is a diverâ€™s life support underwater, and I loved the confidence I got from knowing that my being meticulous in the rebuilding process is what ensured everyone's safety. Just like I love knowing that an app I built can be reliably deployed because of the tests I wrote.

        | I left my native country of France for Asia after obtaining a Master's degree in Translation. This is where my love of languages comes from. I had always been curious about computer languages and when the opportunity to learn programming arose I was excited to seize it. I instantly found it fascinating and loved that a computer does exactly what you tell it to. So different from I was used to with natural languages! I had discovered a passion for figuring out how things worked while I worked in the diving industry, and I found it even more exciting in the computer realm.
