# personal-site

As the name suggests, this is the source code for my [webiste](http://www.noestauffert.com). It was originally deployed to Heroku and was later modified to be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

It's a simple Rails app with activeadmin allowing to dynamically create content for projects and blog posts. The admin side uses Redactor as its WYSIWYG editor, which lets me easily embed images in my posts.
